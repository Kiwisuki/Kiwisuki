### Hi there 👋

🥝 I am aspiring Data Scientist with extra interests in Economics and Real Estate

💼 These are my finished Portfolio Projects:

- 🏠 Aruodas.lt flat's price prediction Machine Learning model, current median accuracy: 8.96%. 
Check out the repo [Check it out](https://github.com/Kiwisuki/Real-Estate-Scraper/blob/main/Data-cleaning-engineering-modelling.ipynb). 😊

- 🌐 Simple, functioning Real Estate website, prototyped after Aruodas.lt, made using Flask, MySQL and MagicDraw. [Check it out](https://github.com/Kiwisuki/Basic-Real-Estate-Website-Flask). 😊
- 🌐 Selenium based web scraper for Aruodas.lt, aggregates all data to MongoDB cloud database, used techniques to avoid Cloudflare bot detection. [Check it out](https://github.com/Kiwisuki/Basic-Real-Estate-Website-Flask). 😊
