### Hi there 👋

🥝 I am Junior Data Scientist at Surfshark with extra interests in Economics and Real Estate

Currently, I have these public portfolio projects:
🏠 Real Estate Project, that consists of:
* Ad scraper from Aruodas.lt , scrapes and aggregates data into MongoDB databse.
* Machine learning model that regresses flat's price, rent, median error ~8%
* Flask website, that is able to regress flat's price, rent, ROI from Aruodas.lt link, using a simple api that invokes scraper,
then transforms data into usable format for machine learning models.
Check out the repo [Check it out](https://github.com/Kiwisuki/Real-Estate-Project). 😊
