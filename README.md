### Hi there 👋

🥝 I am a Data Scientist at Surfshark with extra interests in Economics and Real Estate

My portfolio real estate project:
* Ad scraper from Aruodas.lt , scrapes and aggregates data into MongoDB databse.
* Machine learning model that regresses flat's price, rent, median error ~8%
* Flask website, that is able to regress flat's price, rent, ROI from Aruodas.lt link, using a simple api that invokes scraper,
then transforms data into usable format for machine learning models.
* [Check out the repo](https://github.com/Kiwisuki/Real-Estate-Project). 😊
